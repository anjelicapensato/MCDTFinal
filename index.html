       <p class="about">Molloy College Dance Team is the one and only dance team at the college. The team has been around for years and has continued to improve more and more as time passed. The team used to only perform at men's and women's basketball games. But, just 2 years ago the team started competing in regional competitions against other colleges. <br> <br> This year, finally, the team is making it's way to nationals in florida for the Universal Dance Association competition against colleges around the world! At the competition, the team is going to perform a pom routine with music custom made for the Molloy Lions. The team even hired a choreographer to choreograph the routine into a "UDA style" pom routine! <br> <br> The team mostly performs routines in pom or jazz, and some of their routines during timeouts at basketball games are hiphop. This year the team has improved drastically by improving not only their dancing, but their acrobatic skills as well! </p>
