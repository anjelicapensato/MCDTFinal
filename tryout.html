    <p class="info"> Tryouts consist of two days, the first day we learn a two or three <br>short routines. The routines are commonly pom, jazz and hip-hop. <br>The second day consists of going over the routines and trying out<br>in groups of 3 or 4 people. <br><br> During the tryout in groups, you will be asked to showcase some <br>of your best skills, whether it be turns, jumps or flips, it could be<br>anything you're good at! Don't be discouraged if you don't have<br> many special skills. In order to be on the team, all you need is a <br>basic knowledge of dance and a good work ethic! </p>
